        "abstract": "Visualizations are both a tool for exploration and a mechanism of communication about complex information. The power and potential of visualization work stems from the ability to help people see in new ways. But what people see - and how it helps them make sense of the world - is shaped by more than the tool itself. In this talk, danah will grapple with how contestations over information and communication affect the practice of visualization. Just as data can never be neutral, neither can visualization. This talk will reflect on how visualization experts can navigate biases in data, the politicization of information, and the challenges in communicating uncertainty.",
